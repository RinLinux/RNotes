        This CRAN task view contains a list of packages, grouped by topic, that
      provides functionalities to streamline the process of deploying models to various
      environments, such as mobile devices, edge devices, cloud, and GPUs, for
      scoring or inferencing on new data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Model deployment is often challenging due to various reasons. Some example challenges are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It involves deploying models on heterogenous environments, e.g. edge devices,
        mobile devices, GPUs, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is hard to compress the model to very small size that could fit on devices with limited storage while keeping the same precision and minimizing the overhead to load the model for inference.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deployed models sometimes need to process new data records within limited memory on small devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many deployment environments have bad network connectivity so sometimes cloud solutions may not
        meet the requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          There's interest in stronger user data privacy paradigms where user data does not need to leave the mobile device.
        </li>
        <li>
          There's growing demand to perform on-device model-based data filtering before collecting the data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many of the areas discussed in this Task View are undergoing rapid
      changes in industries and academia. Please send any suggestions to the

          Deployment through Different Types of Artifacts
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This section includes packages that provides functionalities to export the trained
model to an artifact that could fit in small devices such as mobile devices
(e.g. Android, iOS) and edge devices (Rasberri Pi). These packages are built
based on different model format.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) is an XML-based language which
provides a way for applications to define statistical and data mining models
and to share models between PMML compliant applications. The following packages
are based on PMML:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The
<a href="../packages/pmml/index.html">pmml</a>
              package provides the main interface to PMML.
            </li>
            <li>
              The
<a href="../packages/pmmlTransformations/index.html">pmmlTransformations</a>
              package allows for data to be transformed before using it to
      construct models. Builds structures to allow functions in the PMML package to
      output transformation details in addition to the model in the resulting PMML file.
            </li>
            <li>
              The
<a href="../packages/rattle/index.html">rattle</a>
              package allows to load data from a CSV file (or via ODBC), transform and explore the data, build and evaluate models, and export models as PMML or as scores.
            </li>
            <li>
              The
<a href="../packages/arules/index.html">arules</a>
              package provides the infrastructure for representing, manipulating and analyzing transaction data and patterns (frequent itemsets and association rules). The associations can be written to disk in PMML.
            </li>
            <li>
              The
<a href="../packages/arulesSequences/index.html">arulesSequences</a>
              package is an add-on for arules to handle and mine frequent sequences.
            </li>
            <li>
              The
<a href="../packages/arulesCBA/index.html">arulesCBA</a>
              package provides a function to build an association rule-based classifier for data frames, and to classify incoming data frames using such a classifier.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Plain Old Java Object (POJO) or a Model Object, Optimized (MOJO) are intended to
be easily embeddable in any Java environment. The only compilation and runtime
dependency for a generated model is a h2o-genmodel.jar file produced as the
build output of these packages. The
<a href="../packages/h2o/index.html">h2o</a>
          package provides easy-to-use interface to
build a wide range of machine learning models, such as GLM, DRF, and XGBoost models based on
<a href="../packages/xgboost/index.html">xgboost</a>
          package, which can then be exported as MOJO and POJO format. The MOJO and POJO artifacts can then be loaded by its REST interface as well as different language bindings, e.g. Java, Scala, R, and Python.
        </li>
        <li>
          Portable Format for Analytics (PFA) is a specification for event-based
processors that perform predictive or analytic calculations and is aimed at
helping smooth the transition from statistical model development to large-scale
and/or online production. PFA combines the ease of portability across systems with algorithmic flexibility: models, pre-processing, and post-processing are all functions that can be arbitrarily composed, chained, or built into complex workflows. The
<a href="../packages/aurelius/index.html">aurelius</a>
          package provides tools for converting R
objects and syntax into the PFA format.
        </li>
        <li>

            TensorFlow

          <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/">
            TensorFlow Lite
          </a>, which uses many techniques for achieving low latency such as optimizing the kernels for mobile apps, pre-fused activations, and quantized
kernels that allow smaller and faster (fixed-point math) models. It enables
on-device machine learning inference with low latency and small binary size.
The packages listed below can produce models in this format. Note that these packages are R wrappers of their corresponding Python API based on the
<a href="../packages/reticulate/index.html">reticulate</a>
          package. Though Python binary is required for creating the models, it's not required during inference time for deployment.
          <ul>
            <li>
              The
<a href="../packages/tensorflow/index.html">tensorflow</a>
              package provides full access to TensorFlow API for numerical computation using data flow graphs.
            </li>
            <li>
              The
<a href="../packages/tfestimators/index.html">tfestimators</a>
              package provides high-level API to machine learning models as well as highly customized neural network architectures.
            </li>
            <li>
              The
<a href="../packages/keras/index.html">keras</a>
              package high-level API to construct different types of neural networks.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The
<a href="../packages/onnx/index.html">onnx</a>
          package provides the interface to
          <a href="https://onnx.ai/">
            Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)
          </a>
          which is a standard format for models built using different frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow, MXNet, PyTorch, CNTK, etc). It defines an extensible computation graph model, as well as definitions of built-in operators and standard data types. Models trained in one framework can be easily transferred to another framework for inference. This open source format enables the interoperability between different frameworks and streamlining the path from research to production will increase the speed of innovation in the AI community. Note that this package is based on the
<a href="../packages/reticulate/index.html">reticulate</a>
          package to interface with the original Python API so Python binary is required for deployment.
        </li>
        <li>
          The
<a href="../packages/mleap/index.html">mleap</a>
          package is a
<a href="../packages/sparklyr/index.html">sparklyr</a>
          extension that provides an interface to
          <a href="https://github.com/combust/mleap">
            MLeap
          </a>. MLeap is an open source library that enables the persistence of
          <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">
            Apache Spark
          </a>
          ML pipelines and subsequent deployment in any Java-enabled device or service. At runtime, in addition to the serialized model file, the dependencies are a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the MLeap Runtime, and a Spark cluster is not required.
